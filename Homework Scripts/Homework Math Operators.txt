There are several different math operators in C#
They include:
+ additon. Ex. x + x
- subtraction. Ex. x - x
* multiplication. Ex. x * x
/ Division. Ex. x / x
% Modulus. Ex. x % x

All of these are self explanitory, other than maybe Modulus, which divdes, but returns the remainder, rather than the division.

There are also assigning signs and increment/decrement signs.
They include:
= Assign. Ex. int myInt = 8;
+= Increment. Ex. 1 += myInt
-= Decrement. Ex. 100 -= myInt

Assignments are very important throughout all of scripting. They assign the name of a type with a value. This can be used with any type of variable.
Here are some examples:
int myInt = 10;
double myDouble = 10.5;
bool myBool = false;
float myFloat = 10.5;
char myChar = 't';
string myString = "String";

An example of a good use of Decrement, which we used in class, is for health.

Public int health = 100;

 void Update(){
	health -= 1;
	Debug.Log(health);
}

This code creates an int of the name health (Which is public in Unity), then on each update, it decrements 1 from health, than prints it to the console.
While this would decrement your health way too fast, it is a quick easy way to control health.
