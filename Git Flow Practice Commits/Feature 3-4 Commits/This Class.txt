I really like this class. So far, it is a little slow, just because I've already done some of what weve done, but other than that, its good.

I got really confused yesterday, and didn't do my homework, because I thought yesterday was sunday, because of the holiday. It is angering, because I already did my homework
(most of it anyway) so I might get points marked down.
